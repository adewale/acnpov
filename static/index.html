Newitz first dives into the history of evolution and extinction, looking at how past species have survived (or not) and what we can learn from them; then she projects a fascinating and divergent vision of humanity millions of years from now. Hers is an optimistic future, though she acknowledges the path will not be easy. But I found her optimism infectious. My daydreams of late have been of cyborgs and space elevators, terraforming and bioplastics. I hope I can maintain something of that long-term perspective.<img alt="book_cover" class="cover" height="483" src="http://www.aworkinglibrary.com/images/covers/newitz-scatter-adapt-remember.jpg" width="320" /></div>

<h4 lang="en-US"><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/07/03/understanding-apples-organizational-structure/">Understanding Apple’s Organizational Structure</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Apple has hired a new VP who will report directly to Tim Cook. Paul Deneve is cited as having responsibility for “special projects” and will report directly to Tim Cook.</p>
<p>The previous roles as a manager in luxury brand companies has led to a great deal of speculation about what new projects Apple could be working on that might also fit this new manager’s background and title.</p>
<p>The most commonly cited speculation is around the iWatch or TV product lines (with some surprised that he will not be heading Retail.)</p>
<p>Although reading “luxury product CEO” and concluding “new luxury products” seems logical, a little knowledge about how Apple is organized dispels this notion. And a little knowledge happens to be about all we have, as Apple’s organization is one of its most closely guarded secrets. Even employees at Apple have little idea of how the company is organized. What we do know is summarized into this org chart:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-03-at-7-3-3.37.27-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-07-03 at 7-3-3.37.27 PM" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5445" height="620" src="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-03-at-7-3-3.37.27-PM-620x620.png" width="620" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-5442"></span>I’ve taken the liberty of splitting Tim Cook’s direct reports into “Disruptive” and “Sustaining” functions—which I admit is a bit cheeky—but the point is to separate the product creation functions from the management and administrative functions of the organization[2].</p>
<p>When seen in this light, the first observation is that there is no “product business” ownership. Schiller’s Marketing function includes product marketing by product line, but these are not business ownership roles (product marketing mostly deals with how products are positioned, promoted, priced, etc.)</p>
<p>There is no “head of devices” or “head of iPhone”. Put more plainly, there is no organizational consistency with how the company reports its financial performance.</p>
<p>So it would make little sense to add a new direct report to this chart that did have a specific product ownership (or creation) role. Product is a “horizontal” responsibility for which every function is partially responsible.</p>
<p>In lieu of this, my reading of the chart shows another function for which there seems to be no leader: brand. Brand management is a crucial function in consumer-facing companies, and many brands-oriented companies orient their organizations (and power) around brand mangers.</p>
<p>In years gone by I would have said that Brand management was Steve Jobs’ direct responsibility. Today I would say that it’s something that needs a direct manager. This is something for which Paul Deneve might be well suited.</p>

<h4 lang="en-US"><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/07/01/whats-a-blackberry-user-worth/">What’s a BlackBerry user worth?</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Last week BlackBerry announced that it had 72 million subscriber accounts. The current market capitalization is $5.4 billion and enterprise value (i.e. excluding net cash) is about $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>That implies a net present value of about $40 for each account. This is quite a drop from early 2010 when the value was $866.</p>
<p>The graph of BlackBerry subscriber accounts and EV/account is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-01-at-7-1-10.09.16-AM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-07-01 at 7-1-10.09.16 AM" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5438" height="407" src="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-01-at-7-1-10.09.16-AM.png" width="356" /></a><br />
I’ve also added a graph showing a derived value of US consumer BlackBerry users (derived from comScore’s survey data).</p>
<p>There are several patterns which intrigue me:<span id="more-5436"></span></p>
<p>First, the peak in US consumption seems to have happened about two years prior to global peak (lending credence to the notion that <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/10/03/the-crucible-of-the-phone-market/">the US is a smartphone market “crucible”</a>.)</p>
<p>Second, that the collapse in value per user occurred in advance to the peak in users. This is, of course, linked to other user base leading indicators such as device sales momentum. But the drop indicates that there was no perceived value in the BlackBerry install base to begin with. As devices went, so did the company.</p>
<p>Third, this same lack of perceived value <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/06/14/whats-an-apple-user-worth/">seems to be present</a> within the Apple ecosystem (see below), where user value was cut to a third within a few months</p>
<p>. <img alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-14 at 6-14-1.13.26 PM" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5407" height="349" src="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-14-at-6-14-1.13.26-PM.png" width="290" /></p>
<p>In the case of RIM/BlackBerry, the drop in value per user accurately foretold the drop in user base. Does the drop in value per user for Apple foretell a reduction in users?</p>
<p>So far, iOS user base (as proxied by iTunes accounts) continues to expand, even in the US.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>by Frederic Filloux </strong></em></p>
<p><i>The last Data Journalism Awards announced last week at the Global Editors Network News Summit in Paris established one important fact: The genre is getting better, wider in scope and gaining many creative players.</i></p>
<p><b>Data Journalism is thriving.</b> This the most salient conclusion from the second edition of the DJ Awards organized by the <a href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/">Global Editors Network</a> and sponsored by Google. I was part of a 20 persons <a href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/dja/jury/">jury</a>, chaired by Paul Steiger, founder of Pro Publica. We had to choose among a short list of <a href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/dja/">72 projects</a> divided into seven categories: data-driven storytelling, investigation, applications (all three for large and small media), and data-journalism section or website.</p>
<p>Here are some quick personal findings.</p>
<p><b>#1: Data-journalism is a powerful storytelling tool.</b> The Guardian won the Storytelling Big Media category, with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states">this compelling graphic</a> showing the situation of gay rights for each state of the US. It did so by analyzing a range of stats and administrative rules or laws such as hospital visits, adoption, schools or housing. (In half of US states, gays have no clearly stated rights). On that matter, no story could have spoken more loudly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gay_rights_guardian.png?d81f8f"><img alt="gay_rights_guardian" class="alignnone  wp-image-5663" height="354" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gay_rights_guardian.png?d81f8f" width="454" /></a></p>
<p>In a different way, Thomson Reuters collected another prize for its amazing <a href="http://connectedchina.reuters.com/">Connecting China</a> project that looks like a visual LinkedIn for the PRC elite. It’s a huge, 18 months endeavor, built on more than 30,000 connections between Chinese power players.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/china.png?d81f8f"><img alt="china" class="alignnone  wp-image-5662" height="358" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/china.png?d81f8f" width="491" /></a></p>
<p><b>#2: Data-journalism extends well beyond the usual economical/social topics.</b> One DJA 2013 laureate displayed the explanatory power of good data-journalism. The French site <a href="http://quoi.askmedia.fr/">Quoi</a>? explored aspects of the art market. In its Art Market for Dummies (available both in <a href="http://quoi.askmedia.fr/">French</a> and in <a href="http://quoi.info/wp-content/uploads/data_art/en/index.html%23.UdBmRT5OrKW">English</a>), Quoi? explains who are the most bankable artists (since 2008, it’s Picasso, Warhol, Zhang Da Qian); it also shows why it is a terribly dead-male-dominated business; and it illustrates the rise of Chinese artists. It’s both entertaining and information-rich.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/art_market2.png?d81f8f"><img alt="art_market2" class="alignnone  wp-image-5664" height="306" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/art_market2.png?d81f8f" width="491" /></a></p>
<p>Another French company, <a href="http://wedodata.fr/">WeDoData</a> collected an award for a great app showing the (terrible) state of <a href="http://appli-parite.nouvelles-ecritures.francetv.fr/">female/male parity</a> in France, in a smart, user-friendly package commissioned by France Television.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pariteur.png?d81f8f"><img alt="pariteur" class="alignnone  wp-image-5665" height="463" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pariteur.png?d81f8f" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>Another great example of clever data journalism expanding to society issues is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22000973">Great British Class Calculator</a> presented by the BBC (it won the Data-driven apps category). The project started with a survey of 161,000 persons, conducted with several universities. This helped define seven social classes ranging from the Elite, to Precarious Proleteriat, or more imaginative New Affluent workers or Technical Middle Class.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/class_calculator.png?d81f8f"><img alt="class_calculator" class="alignnone  wp-image-5666" height="270" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/class_calculator.png?d81f8f" width="470" /></a></i></p>
<p><b>#3: Tools can be surprisingly simple.</b> In many instances, data-collection and analysis are performed using relatively simple tools such as large Excel or Google Docs spreadsheets (the latter being excellent at scraping data repositories — just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=scrapping+using+google+doc&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t">google the terms</a> to find tons of resources on how to use those. The Argentina newspaper La Nación, winner of the Data-driven Investigations Big Media category, explained in its <a href="http://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/ddj/data-driven-investigative-journalism/argentina-senate-expenses/">DJA filings</a> how it <a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/lndata/senate-expensesslideshare">retrieved</a> 33,000 records showing the expenses of senate members by using sets of Excel macro commands.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/la_nacion_ar.png?d81f8f"><img alt="la_nacion_ar" class="alignnone  wp-image-5661" height="383" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/la_nacion_ar.png?d81f8f" width="488" /></a></p>
<p>For its Art Market for Dummies project, the French multimedia journalist <a href="http://www.jeanabbiateci.fr/">Jean Abbiateci</a> explained how he scraped the ArtPrice database (links are mine):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>For scraping data, I used </i><a href="http://www.outwit.com/"><i>Outwit</i></a><i>, a amazing Firefox Add-on. This is very useful to convert a pdf file to an Excel file. I used Google to refine, to clean and merge my dataset. I used the </i><a href="https://code.google.com/p/currency-converter-api/"><i>Google API Currency Converter</i></a><i> for my uniform monetary values. Finally, I used </i><a href="http://d3js.org/"><i>D3.js</i></a><i> and </i><a href="http://www.highcharts.com/"><i>Hichcharts.js</i></a><i>. I also reused open source code shared by </i><a href="http://www.minnpost.com/data"><i>Minnpost</i></a><i> and a software developer called </i><a href="https://github.com/vlandham"><i>Jim Vallandingham</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>The projects mentioned above are just examples. A visit to the <a href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/dja/">GEN Data Journalism section</a> is well worth your time. For once, the digital news sector has fostered a healthy, creative segment, one that relies a lot on small agile companies. I find that quite encouraging.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>by Jean-Louis Gassée</em></strong></p>
<p><i>Once the king of smartphones for business uses, Blackberry got a new CEO, a new operating system and new devices, with and without the traditional keyboard. In spite of these changes, the company’s latest numbers don’t paint a picture of revival.</i></p>
<p><b>Thorsten Heins doesn’t suffer a lack of enthusiasm.</b> During the run up to the March release of its BlackBerry 10 operating system, RIM’s CEO painted an optimistic picture of a company on the rebound, a company that would <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/22/blackberry-boss-attacks-apple-iphone">correct the mistakes</a> of the industry leaders:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“It’s still the same,” Heins said of the iPhone. “It is a sequential way to work and that’s not what people want today anymore. They want multitasking.”</i></p>
<p>Rechristened as BlackBerry, Heins told us that the company would energize the develop community and spawn devices that are <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57575704-94/blackberry-has-exciting-flagship-phone-planned-for-holidays/">too exciting to describe</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“There’s one new product I’m really excited about, but I can’t really share it,” Heins told CNET in an interview today.</i></p>
<p>Last week, the company released its <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/blackberry-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2014-results-nasdaq-bbry-1806946.htm">latest quarterly numbers</a> and they <i>are</i> exciting, although not in the sense that Heins would like. The forecast was $3.4B in revenue and $0.07 in earnings per share; the reality was $3.1B in sales and, more important, a loss of $0.13 per share.</p>
<p>The numbers “excited” traders so much that BBRY shares lost 28% of their value in a single trading session, putting them back to their one-year-ago level.</p>
<p>The earnings release was followed by the customary conference call where the CEO and CFO review the numbers and answer questions from Wall Street analysts. Courtesy of <a href="http://seekingalpha.com">Seeking Alpha</a>, the call transcript is <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1526612-blackberry-s-ceo-discusses-f1q14-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">here</a> and contains the obligatory pablum, including an excessive abuse of the F-word (22 occurrences):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Embracing our heritage of mobility first is very important as we build our culture and go through this transition. We don’t have to be all things to all people and all markets, and embracing this </i><b><i>focus</i></b><i> allows us to drive efficiency, be flexible and agile, and to ultimately drive best-in-class innovations. [...]<br />
</i><i>We’re continuing to </i><b><i>focus</i></b><i> on improving </i><b><i>all</i></b><i> areas of the business…</i></p>
<p>Curiously, there’s no breakdown of the sales of BlackBerry devices. How much of their revenue was “energized” by the BB10? Without actual numbers, we’re left in a cloud of doubt about how well the new platform is actually doing.</p>
<p>The disquietude continues: There are no subscriber numbers, and no guidance other than an expectation of more losses next quarter. The glowing comments about cash-flow from operations ($630M, a nice number) are undercut by the disclosure of a substantial tax refund, without which the company would have eaten through $400M to $500M of cash.</p>
<p>As for tablets, the Blackberry <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/specifications.html">PlayBook</a> is no more, says the CEO. He’s unhappy with the device’s performance and is determined to <b>focus</b> on the company’s “<i>core hardware portfolio</i>“. (The company’s website no longer describes the product and only offers a software update for existing customers.)</p>
<p><b>Inevitably, the <i>How Many Moves Remain?</i> question comes up.</b> Blackberry professes to do more than just devices, it claims to offer strong enterprise services and says it will propagate its BBM (Blackberry Messenger) to other platforms including Android and iOS. It also promotes a form of (limited) compatibility for (some) Android apps on its newer smartphones. But is anyone buying and in numbers that can save the company?</p>
<p>More to the point: Who wants to buy Blackberry (the company), for what reasons, and at what price?</p>
<p>Let’s back up. Last week, we heard that Microsoft had once again given up on its perennial hunt to capture a handset maker. This time, the prey was Nokia, Microsoft’s “<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1261021-is-nokia-microsoft-partnership-one-sided">special</a>” Windows Phone licensee.</p>
<p>The official explanation for the Nokia blowup was that the price tag was too high, but price clearly wasn’t an issue. Nokia’s $14B <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization">market capitalization</a> weighs in at about 5% of Microsoft’s $288B. Even when you tack on a 25% <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisitionpremium.asp">acquisition premium</a>, the purchase should have been a reasonably easy sell, especially given Microsoft’s desire to take the handset business into its own hands, if only to counter (or mimic) the strategy established by Google and Motorola.</p>
<p>There’s really only one explanation, as I speculated <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2013/06/23/microsoft-and-nokia-wont-beget-a-googorola-clone/">last week</a>: The engagement was dissolved because of Microsoft’s bleak view of Nokia’s business, that the Finnish company no longer has the technological acumen and brand loyalty that Microsoft needs to make Windows Phone a legitimate competitor with Android and iOS.</p>
<p>BlackBerry’s market capitalization now stands at about $6B. That’s less than half of Nokia’s. If Nokia, supported by Microsoft, can’t gain ground on Google and Apple devices, what gives us confidence that BlackBerry isn’t sliding into insignificance?</p>
<p><b>The BlackBerry name, as a brand, is strong.</b> But a brand only exists as the carrier of a promise. A brand writes checks that the product cashes. Without a successful product, the brand dies (go ask Kodak).</p>
<p>While Nokia could be acquired by someone interested in the Windows Phone business, one is hard pressed to form a similar thought for Blackberry. It may be struggling, but there <i>is</i> a Windows Phone ecosystem, including handset makers. There is no such thing around BlackBerry. Developers aren’t writing apps for BB10 in ecosystem-making numbers, carriers have taken a wait-and-see posture, even the core group of dedicated users (I used to be one of them) appears to be losing faith.</p>
<p>This isn’t a brightly optimistic picture. Today, Blackberry finds itself caught between Samsung and Apple at the high end, and a rabidly fermenting crowd of Android (official or not) clones at the lower price range.</p>
<p>So, why not consider heresy, or apostasy: Ditch the newer BlackBerry OS too few developers believe in, and bet on Android devices to support BlackBerry’s enterprise services.</p>
<p>The answer is probably the same as it is for Nokia: It’s too late.</p>

<h4><a href="http://kaigsoc.tumblr.com/post/54263396760">Zhang Kai (GSoC): Weekly Report: sendmail, POP3Client and IMAP4Client</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In the past week, I finished my patch for <a href="http://tm.tl/#6588" target="_blank" title="ticket 6588">ticket 6588</a>(Commands of twisted.mail.pop3client.POP3Client should return a cancellable Deferred) and submitted it for review. During the meeting in Tuesday, Itamar and Ashfall reviewed it. There were a few places I need to revise:</p>
<ol><li>There is no need for a function in a test to be private. So there should be no leading “_" in the names of the helpers in twisted.mail.test.test_pop3client.py</li>
<li>We need to assert that the connection is not disconnected when user canceled a command in blocked queue.</li>
<li>Instead of “Test cancel XXX", we should write e<span class="short_text" id="result_box"><span class="hps">xplicitly what we are testing in the docstring of the tests.<br /></span></span></li>
<li><span class="short_text"><span class="hps">Exarkun talked about the private positional argument API anti-pattern in a mail sent to Twisted-Python list. Glyph furthermore gave a reason why it’s best to make a private</span></span><span class="short_text"><span class="hps"> reactor *attribute* public. So the private argument “_reactor" of sendmail should be changed to public argument “reactor".<br /></span></span></li>
</ol><p><span class="short_text"><span class="hps">After the meeting, I revised my patches according to the comments above. Then I began to work on adding deferred cancellation support to twisted.mail.imap4.IMAP4Client.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span class="short_text"><span class="hps">The implementation of IMAP4Client is similar to the implementation of POP3Client. </span></span>All the commands of an instance of IMAP4Client share one connection and are pipelined into a queue. Like what we do in the POP3Client case, when a command is waiting in the queue we can easily cancel it by removing it from the queue.</p>
<p>However, unlike the pop3 protocol, there is no update phase in imap4 protocol. All the commands take affect immediately on server side if the server return a “OK" response. So even if we can abort the connection to cancel a trying command, there is still a chance that we cannot cancel it successfully.</p>
<p>We need to discuss whether this is acceptable or should we do something else in this situation.</p>
<p>Plan for next week:</p>
<p>First, we need to discuss and decide what should we do to cancel a trying command of IMAP4Client. Then I will file a ticket about adding deferred cancellation support to IMAP4Client and implement the patch for it.</p></div>

<div class="content">
With a market capitalization of more than $374 billion as of Wednesday’s close, Apple is worth far more than Google, which has a market cap that now sits at $290 billion. As The Wall Street Journal’s MoneyBeat blog points out, however, Google has surpassed Apple as the world’s most valuable tech company when using a less conventional measure. “The market caps of both companies are swelled by their huge bank accounts. Strip out Apple’s $145 billion of net cash as of March, and Google’s $45 billion,” MoneyBeat’s Rolfe Winkler wrote. ”This leaves an enterprise value of $233 billion for Apple, but $241 billion for Google, reflecting the underlying value of the companies’ actual operations.” Winkler uses a good analogy to help</div>

<h4 lang="en"><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/26/how-game-publishers-like-kabam-and-zynga-use-mobile-ads-to-get-on-app-store-leaderboards/">33a32-chinagame</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Getting to the top of the app store charts is critical for maximizing monetization. But how do top game publishers like Kabam, Zynga, and Supercell get there … and stay there?</p>
<p>“It starts with having a great game,” <a href="http://RTB.com" target="_blank">RTB</a> founder Fred Hsu told me. “You can hope the app gods will grace you and push your game up the charts, but the odds are low … it may happen, but it’s a one in 10,000 chance.”</p>
<p>Hsu’s company, RTB, runs a significant fraction of mobile ads bought via automated real-time bidding. Currently, the company is handling three billion impressions every day and reaching hundreds of millions of users every month. In other words, this man knows his ads. And mobile gaming companies are among his biggest customers.</p>
<p>Often, the campaign starts in Australia or New Zealand.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/kabam.png" target="_blank"><img alt="logo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-712238" height="163" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/kabam.png?w=300&amp;h=163" width="300" /></a>“We see a lot of soft bursts, where companies spend some cash to gobble up users in Australia and New Zealand,” Hsu says. “They want to be a big fish in a small pond … it gives them the best proxy to raise a bigger budget for a broader launch in North America or Western Europe.”</p>
<p>New Zealand and Australia are closely aligned with Western countries in taste and style, not to mention language, so they provide a good first audience. Often, the path looks like a global stepping stone: New Zealand to Australia, Australia to Canada, and Canada to the United States. It’s a step-by-step approach that ensures game mechanics, monetization mechanisms, and user acquisition and retention models make sense and are working well before publishers enter the big markets, where they need to spend real marketing dollars.</p>
<p>Those mechanics include cohort analysis to measure app drop-out, attrition, and the costs of replacing lost users. And the specifics of those mechanics will drive ad spend and velocity.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, what app developers need is high-quality users to come in their game,” Hsu told me. “They don’t need people who install their game just because they wanted 3,000 fuzzy points for some other cute game.”</p>
<p>In addition, they need scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zynga-poker-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="zynga poker 1" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-537506" height="220" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/zynga-poker-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=220" width="300" /></a>Adding 500 users in a Facebook promotion is fine, but doesn’t move the needle. Big games need big users — hundreds of thousands, if not millions — and to do that, you need marketing scale. That’s why mobile marketing works, Hsu says. Not only do you have huge numbers of targeted users, you’re also hitting them right where they need to be in order to install the game.</p>
<p>Seeing these campaigns over and over, Hsu says, makes RTB feel like IBM or Mackenzie — consultants who see the same problems many times in different games by different publishers. According to Hsu, there are six key mistakes that gaming companies who fail make:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not optimizing the landing page: <span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">“Some gaming companies don’t realize how important it is how your app pages looks,” Hsu says. “If you have two stars and lousy images, it’ll probably drive a lot of users away.”</span></span> </li>
<li>Having a subpar game: <span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">“What’s your DNA?  Are you really a hardcore gaming company? If not, you might spend a lot of money and forever run into a wall,” Hsu said.</span></span> </li>
<li>Ignoring your analytics infrastructure: <span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you don’t understand your cohorts, your attrition, user acquisition costs, and the lifetime value of a user, you’re setting yourself up for failure.</span></span> </li>
<li>Crossing your fingers and wishing for organic luck: <span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Wishing for luck is not a business strategy — nor a winning one.</span></span> </li>
<li><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/33a32-chinagame.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="33a32-chinagame" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-760757" height="168" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/33a32-chinagame.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" width="300" /></a>Spending massively in the U.S. before testing elsewhere: <span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">“If you’re Zynga or Supercell, you know what you’re doing, and you have great product quality, you can start in fifth gear,” Hsu said. Everyone else should walk before running.</span></span> </li>
<li>Thinking they can do it themselves: <span style="font-size: 13px;">“I realize this is almost self-serving, but especially the smaller studios are very scrappy. They think they can just go onto Millennial Media or Admob and just test this themselves,” Hsu says. “But if you don’t do it right, you may come up with conclusions that are wrong.”</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Hsu knows a little about growing businesses. He founded domain registry and marketing firm Oversee in 2000 and then sold a minority stake in 2008 for $150 million, all without outside funding. (Unless you count his mother’s credit cards, Hsu says.) And the quickly growing RTB boosted the number of mobile impressions its selling 110 percent from January to April this year.</p>
<p>Which brings up another key point about successful games:</p>
<p>“Quick iteration is really important; you need to improve it after weeks, not months,” Hsu says. “On Android that could be as quick as days, while for iOS … we see updates every two to three weeks.”</p>

</div></div><p>Europeans are losing interest in Apple.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUK24197413" target="_blank">International Data Corporation (IDC) released a report</a> which found that the Western European mobile phone market shrunk in the first quarter of 2013 due to a slowdown in smartphone shipments.</p>
<p>Apple continues to lose ground, while Android continues to “dominate the smartphone landscape.” IDC found that Apple’s iOS dropped to 20% market share — a year-over-year drop of 11 percent. Apple shipped 6.2 million units this quarter, which is down from 7 million units at this time last year.</p>
<p>IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo attributed these trends to the European economic climate. He said the region is now entering the second wave of smartphone adoption, which is primarily motivated by cost<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/05/european-economy-guide" target="_blank">. Europe has been “mired in recession” </a>for the past couple years and consumers are less willing to shell out the big bucks for “fancy gadgets” when they can access the same apps from cheaper devices. People that already have higher-end smartphones are also more prone to holding on them for longer periods of time, rather than regularly trading up.</p>
<p>“Most Western European countries experienced a slowdown in smartphone sales as economies deteriorated, with a consequent decline in disposable income for consumers,” the report said. “Mobile operators are also cutting handset subsidies to reduce their costs as revenues decline. In Western Europe, phone makers are facing the most challenging time ever; the economic environment is impacting demand, while users are buying cheaper handsets, which impacts manufacturers margins.”</p>
<p>Smartphone shipments increased by 12% year over year to 31.6 million units this quarter, but this is the lowest growth rate this market has seen since 2004. Samsung shipped 14.3 million of those phones, which is more than Apple, Sony, LG and Nokia combined.</p>
<p>This report followed on the heels of another report yesterday which found that<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-25/hardware/40184299_1_micromax-and-karbonn-manasi-yadav-smartphone-shipments" target="_blank"> Samsung dominates the Indian smartphone market in unit sales as well as value,</a> and Apple didn’t even make the top 5 in the first quarter. India is now the third largest smartphone market in the world and are turning the subcontinent into the “sleeping giant” of smartphone markets. Android has a 90% market share.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Apple-obsessed world of Silicon Valley, where people get worked into a tizzy over iOS7 and camp out over night to get the latest iPhone, this is a reminder that iPhones are out of reach for a majority of people around the world. Emerging markets, however, present massive opportunities. When asked about the possibility of making a cheaper iPhone for these consumers, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/02/12/no-cheap-iphone-apples-religion-is-we-must-do-something-great/">Apple CEO Tim Cook said </a>“the only thing we’ll never do is make a crappy product. That’s the only religion we have: We must do something great.”</p>
<p>He also pointed out that Apple has aggressively lowered prices on products in the past and that it will eventually bring out a less expensive phone, without comprising quality. Rumors about the elusive budget iPhone continue to circulate and last week <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/15/apples-budget-iphone-expected-to-have-same-4-inch-display-as-iphone-5" target="_blank">AppleInsider released a 3D rendering based on leaked blueprint images</a>. The phone is thought to the plastic, although the CEO Chinese company Pegatron — which is handling a portion of the manufacturing — said that the “price is still high.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Apple’s less expensive competitors are scooping up existing (and future) marketshare around the world.</p>

Big name companies such as Path, Facebook, Tumbler and Twitter were quick to develop applications for Google’s wearable computing device.

</div></div><p>Score one for independent digital media: When Texas state senator Wendy Davis (D) stood for a 13-hour filibuster on a controversial abortion bill last night, Twitter and a nonprofit online publication’s livestream were the main sources for the news.</p>
<p>Major cable news outlets, however, were oddly missing from this story.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Davis stood on the Texas State Senate floor for 13 hours, 11 of which were spent filibustering a Senate Bill 5, bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and had major implications for abortion clinics around the state. According to the senate’s rules for a filibuster, she could not sit, lean on anything, take any bathroom breaks, or talk about anything but the bill at hand. By yesterday evening, it was clear that it was shaping up to be a dramatic news event, but it seemed only Texas newspapers and social media recognized it as such.</p>
<p>The news spread widely through Twitter and Facebook. If you were interested in following along in real time, you could watch the livestream on the <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/" target="_blank">Texas Tribune’s website</a> (which was also on YouTube), a nonprofit online news publication, or you could follow the “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23StandWithWendy&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">StandWithWendy</a>” trending hashtag on Twitter. But, you couldn’t watch it on a major cable news channel: CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News all seemed to be mute on the subject.</p>
<p>“I think this is largely representative of the fact that the mainstream national media doesn’t pay that much attention to state government,” said Emily Ramshaw, an editor at the Texas Tribune, in an interview with VentureBeat. “I think in a lot of ways, there was no way for the national news to know that this was going on.”</p>
<p>(It should be noted that Ramshaw had been up for 36 hours without sleep at the time of our interview. I hope she’s gone to bed by now.)</p>
<p>The Tribune offered the only livestream available last night, which attracted at its peak over 183,000 viewers — record traffic for the online publication. It captured moments <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=yPntuZ7jmGY#at=19" target="_blank">like this one</a>, when state senator Leticia Van de Putte (D) demanded to know when women had to raise their hands or voices to be heard over their male colleagues — a pivotal moment in the filibuster.</p>
<p>Ramshaw explained that this was the first time a livestream was allowed in the Texas State Senate — and it took the Tribune three years of lobbying to get that privilege. The effort payed off: In addition to the record traffic, celebrities such as documentary director Michael Moore, <em>Girls </em>creator/star Lena Dunham, and even President Barack Obama <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/349703625616011264" target="_blank">tweeted a link to the Tribune’s livestream</a>.</p>
<p>You’d expect, however, that major cable news providers would have the skills and connections over a nascent local online publication to get cameras inside a state senate building, especially after more than 10 hours of filibustering on a hot news topic that was blowing up on social media.</p>
<p>Anderson Cooper was criticized on Twitter for covering blueberries as the filibuster was coming to a high point. One person <a href="https://twitter.com/juju_freakshow/status/349775286281314304" target="_blank">tweeted</a>, “@AndersonCooper cover the calories in a blueberry muffin as TX filibuster was building to a close? #muffinsmoreimportantthanwomensrights.”</p>
<p>Anderson Cooper’s television show announced that it would have Wendy Davis on its show as a follow up today.</p>
<p>MSNBC pointed out to VentureBeat that it ran a segement on The Rachel Maddow Show, and the MaddowBlog liveblogged the filibuster. Significant live video coverage, however, was not supplied.</p>
<p>We’ve asked for comment from CNN and Fox News but have not received any comments from the three. Texas governor Rick Perry announced today that he would open another special session to disucss the bill, so perhaps cable news outlets will have another opportunity to take the lead on coverage.</p>
<p>Twitter, as has increasingly been the case, proved to be a good place to get up-to-the-minute, if not always accurate, information. People monitored hashtags such as #Sb5, #TXlege, or #StandWithWendy. They also followed on-the-ground newspaper journalists such as Mike Ward (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikestatesman" target="_blank">@mikestatesman</a>), who writes from the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> and updated frequently with up-to-the-minute information.</p>
<p>There were 730,000 total tweets regarding the filibuster today, according to stats Twitter provided VentureBeat. At its peak, 11:58 p.m. Central Time, Twitter was seeing 5,776 tweets per minute. Overall 400,000 tweets mentioned “#StandWithWendy,” and Twitter followers on her @WendyDavisTexas account grew eight times. Texas led with the most tweets, followed by California and New York.</p>
<p>It was good for the Texas Tribune, too. The publication got a total of $23,000 in donations as a result of its coverage.</p>
<p>“So much of what happens in state legislatures happens behind closed doors,” said Ramshaw. “The only reason the entire world knew about this was because a gritty nonprofit news organization pushed and pushed for legislators to let us stream live video.”</p>

</div></div><p><a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/home" target="_blank">Motorola Mobility</a> has undergone plenty of changes since it was purchased by <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/22/google-motorola-deal-closed/" target="_blank">Google for $12.5 billion</a> back in 2012, but the latest change might be its most prominent yet.</p>
<p>Today a handful of tech sites are reporting that Motorola is ditching its red button “M” Logo in favor of something much more colorful. As you can see from the image above, the company’s new logo sports a rainbow-color circle with the familiar M inside. The company also ditched its boring italicized “MOTOROLA,” and opted for an all lowercase “motorola” with a thinner font style. There’s also the added “a Google Company” tag line, too.</p>

It’s worth noting that this particular logo also appears with a purple “M” button on the <a href="http://techweek.com/chicago/" target="_blank">TechWeek event’s sponsor page</a>, but doesn’t appear anywhere on the company’s website.</p>
<p>A new logo would make sense, given the new direction the company is moving under Google. Motorola Mobility new strategy is to focus on making fewer devices with innovative features. It’s new flagship smartphone <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/29/motorolas-next-phone-the-moto-x-will-be-made-in-texas/" target="_blank">Moto X</a> will run Google Android operating system and be produced in Texas later this year.</p>

Any hope of slowing down Samsung’s quest to completely dominate the Android market may rest with the HTC One. Barron’s points us to a new note from Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt, who says that while Samsung’s Galaxy S4 has posted strong early sales, it has been “losing steam” in recent weeks thanks to a combination of “the HTC One and reversion from the pre-launch hype for the S4.” McCourt’s research backs up other promising reports we’ve seen about early HTC One sales this month, although it’s not clear if having a hit smartphone will be enough to rescue HTC from its current financial troubles.

<p>On the eve of its release, graphics-chip maker Nvidia is delaying the Shield portable Android gaming device.</p>
<p>Nvidia, best known for making the graphics cards in some PCs and smart devices, found an issue with its upcoming handheld that forced it to move the release of the device to July, <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-9020_7-57591105-222/nvidia-delays-shield-to-july-due-to-11th-hour-dilemma/" target="_blank" title="CNET: Nvidia Shield">according to CNET</a>.</p>
<p>“The issue relates to a third-party mechanical component, and we’re working around the clock with the supplier to get it up to our expectations,” <a href="http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/06/26/shield-delayed/" target="_blank" title="Nvidia: Blog">Shield director Jason Paul wrote in a company blog</a>. “We apologize to those who have preordered Shields and to all those who are waiting for them to go on sale. But we want every Shield to be just right.”</p>
<p>The company previously intended to launch the game online and at retail tomorrow.</p>
<p>Shield is the showcase product for Nvidia’s upcoming Tegra 4 processor, which is the company’s next-gen graphics-processing unit (GPU) for mobile devices. The chip’s precursor, the Tegra 3, powers devices like Google’s Nexus 7 tablet and Ouya’s Android microconsole.</p>
<p>Possibly to jump start demand for Tegra 4, Nvidia created the $300 portable gaming device with full physical controls similar to the gamepad that comes with an Xbox 360 and a 5-inch high-definition touchscreen.</p>
<p>By running Android, Shield also has full access to Google’s Play app market, which means anyone invested in that ecosystem can simply download their games (like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City) to the handheld.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nvidia will use the Shield to experiment with local game streaming. That means streaming full games from a local PC so Shield owners can play them while away from their desktop system. This functionality is only compatible with certain Nvidia GeForce GTX-based graphics cards and games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Dishonored, and Borderlands 2.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p><em>Marco Veremis is the CEO and founder of Upstream.</em></p>
<p>Mobile manufacturers are falling over themselves to debut new handsets that cater to emerging markets, with BlackBerry’s new Q5 and Nokia’s new $99 device as just two of the latest entrants to the market. </p>
<p>Focusing on everything from QWERTY keyboards to inexpensive cost models, mobile manufacturers have clearly zeroed in on emerging markets as their next big growth market.  </p>
<p>It’s no surprise, as there are signs that many of the mobile giants, including Google and Apple, have saturated the Western world. Instead, the next 1 billion users for these companies could very well come from emerging markets, where smartphone use is in its nascent stage and a heavy reliance on feature phone devices still exists. </p>
<p>Recently, we saw Google enter the competition for emerging market users, with a rumored plan to develop and build wireless networks in emerging markets including Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. </p>
<p><strong>So just why is Google heading to Kenya?</strong></p>
<p>Mobile phone use in emerging markets has skyrocketed in recent years, but the lack of reliable mobile network infrastructure or 3G in emerging markets has been a significant barrier to the data use required by smartphones. By creating local wireless broadband access, Google has more opportunities to not only increase use of its Internet and search engine products, but also potentially of its Android mobile operating system. In addition, stronger and more accessible networks would also improve the potential for Google’s mobile advertising and marketing, which would suffer in developing countries from expensive data rates and slow connection speeds. </p>
<p><strong>But if you build it, will they come?</strong></p>
<p>While emerging markets are ripe with opportunities for mobile marketing, a recent study commissioned by my company, <a href="http://www.upstreamsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Upstream</a>, and conducted by third-party research firm <a href="http://today.yougov.com/" target="_blank">YouGov</a> found that mobile attitudes in emerging markets differ dramatically from those in the West. For example, unlike U.S. users, only 21 percent of consumers in emerging markets polled aspired to own an Apple handset. </p>
<p>Instead, removing price from consideration, users in emerging markets said they would most likely buy a Samsung (32 percent), followed by Nokia (22 percent). BlackBerry trailed the pack, with just 10 percent of the vote.<br />
In addition, 31 percent of consumers in emerging markets want pay-as-you-go data services, and only 29 percent want to pay via debit or credit card. </p>
<p>The concern for most of these users is the total cost of ownership rather than device cost. Essentially, offering the right kind of device, along with the right level of data plan, is critical to success in developing countries. Unlike your typical app store, tech giants like Apple and Google will need to come up with new more flexible platforms through which they can sell content. </p>
<p><strong>So where’s the opportunity in emerging markets?</strong></p>
<p>One of the fundamental differences between Western users and those in emerging markets lies in the use cases driving smartphone adoption. Emerging market users are very different than those in the West; their desire to use smartphones is driven by more basic services. </p>
<p>In a number of countries where we operate, one of our “killer apps” is actually English lessons. Simply put, mobile strategies that have worked in the West won’t work in emerging markets, but this all means that there’s a lot of additional opportunity for brands to publish apps with completely different content than that of current apps on the market. </p>
<p>It may also seem strange to U.S. audiences, but 41 percent of consumers polled in emerging markets would like to purchase a mobile device developed by their favorite social network. That may seem crazy given the recent backlash faced by Facebook Home in the United States. In reality, social networks like Facebook and Twitter who aspire to “own” the handset could have major potential overseas. </p>
<p>Mobile in emerging markets will continue to be a competitive battlefield over the next few years, especially as device manufacturers like Apple and Google have to compete with Chinese handset manufacturers, who can deliver at the price point required in emerging markets. It will be interesting to see which of the leaders in the West leverages the differences in emerging markets to secure their next billion users. </p>

Sony has been very eager to capitalize on the multiple mistakes Microsoft made in rolling out the Xbox One and now a new report from IGN suggests that Sony’s plans to stick a shiv into Microsoft may have been in the works for months. Unnamed sources tell IGN that Sony decided to scrap plans to require gamers to buy a PlayStation Eye sensor long before it unveiled pricing information at E3 in June. Ditching the Kinect-like PlayStation Eye let Sony knock a full $100 off the price tag for its next-generation console. More crucially, Sony also didn’t tell any of its partners about plans for a price cut to keep Microsoft in the dark. The result was that Sony earned</div>

The photos appear to be stills from a promotional video showcasing the Optimus G2, or simply “G2” as it is called in the images, and the tagline “learning from you” suggests that the handset may feature some kind of adaptive functionality. The volume buttons also appear to be situated on the back of the phone instead of a side edge.

</div></div><p>Google Glass is for walking around and getting directions to a cafe with perfect espresso. Recon Jet is for kicking your performance into the ultimate high gear and — yes — even saving lives.</p>
<p>The Vancouver, B.C.-based <a href="http://reconinstruments.com" target="_blank">Recon Instruments</a>, which created the first-ever heads-up display for sports in 2010, has launched the Recon Jet <a href="http://jet.reconinstruments.com" target="_blank">for preorders today</a>. It’s essentially a rugged take on Google Glass with perfect balance that does not require Wi-Fi or cellular connections, works in any weather conditions, and provides data-at-a-glance even under the worst viewing conditions.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/recon-jet_white.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Recon Jet_White" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-770438" height="293" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/recon-jet_white.jpg?w=558&amp;h=293" width="558" /></a></p>
<p>“Recon Jet is an extremely activity-specific device,” company CMO Tom Fowler — a former professional triathlete — told me today. “We do not aspire to be the general purpose device you wear when walking around in daily life but the device you need when you’re engaged in a specific activity at a very high level.”</p>
<p>In other words, Google Glass is consumer. Recon Jet is pro.</p>
<p>The device, which is embedded within a pair of sunglasses, weighs just 28 grams — less than an ounce — and is weighted perfectly with 14 grams to a side. Included in that ounce is a dual-core 1GHz processor, a graphics chip, Wi-Fi, built-in ANT+ for device communications, Bluetooth, GPS, a HD camera, and a raft of sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, altimeter, magnetometer, and thermometer. And, of course, it has an HD display, infrared gaze detection, a mic, speakers, and a touchpad that Fowler says works even with gloves and even when it’s snowing.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo"></div>
<p>Cyclists like Fowler could use it to monitor performance. Runners and other athletes can access data from their fitness bands, shoe sensors, and body monitors without having to pull out a phone, open an app, and check a screen. And yes, you can get your texts and smartphone notifications as well as call display on Jet. But industry pros can use it as well: engineers, firefighters, builders, and doctors.</p>
<p>And in the hands of doctors, this kind of access to information can save lives.</p>
<p>“I showed this to a U.S. Army doctor who had done a couple of tours in Afghanistan,” Fowler told me. “He said that if he had had Recon Jet in Afghanistan delivering patient vital stats while operating … there are people who would have made it who, sadly, did not. That’s a pretty inspiring mission.”</p>
<p>But there are also some consumer-friendly social features, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-26-at-11-54-47-am.png" target="_blank"><img alt="data from the Recon Jet" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-770445" height="156" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-26-at-11-54-47-am.png?w=558&amp;h=156" width="558" /></a></p>
<p>When you take HD video or pictures with the built-in camera, Fowler says, you can elect to have it automatically upload to your Facebook or other social accounts. So a rider who just finished an inside mountain climb, or a weekend warrior who just completed a 3K run, could share their victories with their friends and community. Then, as people respond, those comments and congratulations will show up on your heads-up display.</p>
<p>What about Google as a competitor?</p>
<p>You’d think that Google would be a nightmare competitor to small company in the face-mounted wearable computing space. Not so. Fowler says he couldn’t be happier that Google launched Glass, because the search, software, and device giant is pumping up massive consumer interest in the market — interest that Recon intends to capitalize on.</p>
<p>But the Jet has a critical component that’s still coming: the open SDK. Recon wants the developer community to build anything and everything on this platform, and it’s already working with health and fitness companies to create apps for devices and data.</p>
<p>Product ordered today will be delivered in December of this year — probably around the same time Google Glass makes it to consumer release — and the SDK will be available “shortly.” Those who are interested should probably try to pick up a pair now — the price goes up to $599 when the product is actually in the market.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I know I'm late but I still can't see this part of the deal showing up...</p> <p>So, it's no news that Google first disallowed new s2s connections, then started their own protocol, which has no s2s connections at all.</p> <p>With that, the largest node of the public Jabber network went down, incorporating the largest share of its users. They're pointing to spam:</p> <br /><blockquote>Chee Chew said that "we haven't seen significant uptake" in federation with Google Talk via server-to-server connections. The majority of the uptake Google did see was from organizations or individuals looking to bombard Google Talk users with chat spam </blockquote><i><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/hands-on-with-hangouts-googles-new-text-and-video-chat-architecture/">Ars Technica</a></i><p></p> <p>And also did the original dream of Jabber.</p> <br /><blockquote>By assigning    server identity as a hostname, servers are also able to route data    directly to each other and their connected clients, thereby creating    a new, inherently open IM network out of all the individual    installed servers and clients.   </blockquote><i><a href="http://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/attic/draft-jabber-00.txt">Jabber internet Draft</a></i> <p>There is no open IM network anymore: we have some walled gardens supporting the XMPP c2s protocol for easy access. </p> <p>For years, I've been dreaming - and trying to get funds - for a mail system competing GMail, but being compatible with it both in e-mail and IM - that's not possible anymore. </p> <p>I was <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aadaam1/unified-instant-messaging-in-hungary">urging</a> Hungarian e-mail providers - some of them providing their own XMPP implementation - to allow external IM connections between each other and gmail - that's not possible anymore.  </p><p>The open network of communication won't be brought by XMPP, that's for sure.</p> <p>Jabber failed to provide good enough <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/hands-on-with-hangouts-googles-new-text-and-video-chat-architecture/">spam protection</a>, failed to provide a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS48X9oEar0">scalable protocol</a>, failed to provide easy transfer of accounts between providers (if I change e-mail address, I don't have to re-add all my friends, it's enough to set a simple forward or inbox pulling - that's not true for Jabber IDs!)</p> <p>Besides, no matter what was the dream, it turned out, the complexity is mostly on the client side, and that IM networks are <a href="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/rationaledge/jun07/BoochEtAl_CH01.pdf?S_TACT=105AGX52&amp;S_CMP=cn-a-r">inherently complex</a>. We had a lot of clients able to transfer basically text-only messages. <a href="https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/1768#comment:23">Not even files</a>. </p> <p>Also, given the fragmentation of the community - it's not a product, it's a protocol community somehow - Jabber failed to gain developer interest it seems - instead of Jingle, the way for A/V communications <a href="http://www.geek.com/apps/firefox-22-brings-odinmonkey-for-web-gaming-webrtc-for-chat-1560122/">seems to be WebRTC now</a>. </p> <p>For message broadcasting and queing, there are a lot of protocols available. XMPP is one of them. For me, XMPP was an open protocol and network for human-to-human communication, and it seems it has failed its mission. It's only used as a fallback protocol for IM clients. </p> <p>So, it seems we're struck with walled gardens for a while again.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Forget the Start button or the ability to boot up to desktop mode — Windows 8.1 has a much cooler feature than either of those things. As Ars Technica reports, Windows 8.1 will feature both a standard driver and an application programming interface designed specifically for 3D printing. What makes this so enticing, Ars notes, is that “developers will be able to use the new API to integrate 3D printing dialog boxes into their applications, making it that much easier to print your designs using that $200 3D printer you just bought.” Adding native support for 3D printing is a pretty clever maneuver for Microsoft as it tries to move aggressively into what looks to be a quickly growing emerging technology.</div>

</div></div><p>Whether you eating high-end Vietnamese cuisine in a Mission garage or trying on jewelry in an art gallery, pop-up shops provide unique consumer experiences.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thestorefront.com" target="_blank">Storefront</a> is a startup that wants to create more of these experiences, by making it easier for anyone to find and rent short-term retail space. Today, Storefront announced raising $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into new markets, starting with New York City.</p>
<p>Opening a retail store can be an expensive and time-consuming process. As a result, chefs, artisans, and designers are increasingly turning to online stores or pop-up shops. <a href="http://www.danter.com/statistics/rentvac.htm" target="_blank">The average national vacancy rates for retail space is 10 percent</a>, which Storefront said represents nearly $20 billion in lost rent annually.</p>
<p>Storefront’s goal is to make starting an offline store as easy as an online store. It  matches people who need retail space with people who have it, and it tries to cut down on some of the friction involved with starting a physical store. Using the site, entrepreneurs can enter their requirements and search for spaces. Each listing includes detailed descriptions of the neighborhood, photos, nearby businesses, foot traffic, and photographs. Storefront also offers flexible booking and a standardized legal process that streamlines lease agreements and insurance.</p>
<p>Despite the rise of e-commerce, a vast majority of retail still happens offline. Pop-ups allow people to connect with their consumers, build strong relationships, and generate buzz at a lower cost with less risk. Storefront started out in San Francisco, which is home to a vibrant pop-up scene. Restaurants and boutiques here host pop-ups, and many of them go on to establish independent businesses once they get a bit of traction. Brands can also use pop-ups to fuel holiday sales, test new markets, or build buzz for new products.</p>
<p>Storefront has listed over 3 million square feet of retail space in the last six months and helped over 100 brands and companies open pop-up shops in San Francisco. It has partnered with real estate agents and malls like Westfield, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and Jones Lang LeSalle to list their unused space. In New York, Storefront has options such as a luxury Soho store or a spot in Grand Central Terminal.</p>
<p>Erik Eliason and Tristan Pollack previously founded and sold blog SocialEarth to 3BL Media in 2012. They then founded Storefront, which participated in the Angelpad accelerator Fall 2012 class. Mohr Davidow Ventures, Great Oaks VC, 500 Startups, David Tisch’s Box Group, Sand Hill Angels, and others participated in this round.</p>
<p>Storefront is based in San Francisco.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p><em>Esther Perez is a systems engineer and database administrator.</em></p>
<p>I’ve been a systems engineer and database administrator for fifteen years now, and it’s fair to say that there have been more than a few large-scale shifts in information technology in that time. Perhaps no technology trend has driven a greater amount of change in that period, though, than the rise of big data. </p>
<p>Big data, when harnessed properly, is undoubtedly a good thing. It enables people and organizations alike to make more accurate, data-driven decisions based on past and expected behavior. While organizations have been analyzing large data sets for better business and operational insights for some time now, it wasn’t until forward-thinking companies like Facebook and Google began building custom databases that were specifically intended for larger data sets that the big data movement really took off. </p>
<p>The big data ecosystem is comprised of a large pool of modern databases and software packages, all of which require specialized training or certification to be harnessed properly. With this in mind, it’s no surprise that the Harvard Business Review recently referred to the data scientist, whose primary responsibility is to analyze complex data sets with these tools, as the “<a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank">sexiest job of the 21st century</a>.”<br />
Moreover, all signs point to the continued growth of storage and big data analytics as the Moore’s Law of the next decade.</p>
<p>As exciting as this is for engineers, it also poses new challenges. For one, while organizations across the board have largely acknowledged that they should leverage the increasing volumes of data they’re generating and storing, there’s still a considerable amount of confusion around how exactly to do that. According to a March 2013 study from European research firm Interxion, 69 percent of European organizations view big data as a moderate or significant business challenge. </p>
<p>Additionally, most engineers, myself included, were trained before the rise of the big data ecosystem. There were no courses in our respective engineering schools on Hadoop, and we didn’t receive specialized training on HBase or Hive. While there’s a growing group of recent engineering graduates that had the luxury of learning these skills in university, the majority of engineers out there today still predate the rise of big data. </p>
<p>In an effort to attract top engineering students, a growing number of high-profile universities – Harvard, MIT and Columbia among them – have begun to incorporate big data and data science-centric majors. While this does in theory make it easier for mid-career engineering professionals to gain the requisite skills needed to stay competitive in a fast-changing field, it’s not always so simple. </p>
<p>Taking the necessary time and resources to pause your career and go back to school for one or two years is an extremely risky professional move for most; it’s not as if your employer is simply going to wait two years for you to complete a program and hand your job back once you have a degree in hand. </p>
<p>There is an alternative to this approach, however. A growing number of online learning platforms aimed at providing technical training and certification have appeared in recent years. Some notable examples include Coursera, Khan Academy and <a href="http://www.bigdatauniversity.com/" target="_blank">Big Data University</a>, all of which are free of charge (a stark contrast to the wave of for-profit “universities” that had previously dominated the online education landscape). </p>
<p>These platforms are an extremely useful medium for mid-career professionals who are looking for a cost- and time-effective means by which they can gain necessary training for big data tools without sacrificing their existing jobs. Given the fragile economic conditions that exist in most of the world today, this is an especially invaluable feature.</p>
<p>In my case, I have enrolled in Big Data University, where I recently completed a free course on integrating Jaspersoft’s reporting tool with Hadoop to effectively display large data sets in a manner that allows non-engineers to easily digest and understand it. I completed the course and gained the subsequent certification in just two weeks, and am now in the process of enrolling in additional courses there. </p>
<p>I live in Spain, where the economy is particularly dire. While I’m finding myself tasked with working with big data more and more on a daily basis, the idea of walking away from my current job and investing money in another degree is unthinkable. With the highest unemployment rate in the EU,  job competition can be cutthroat to say the least and high level education  is the best way break out from that trap.</p>
<p>The rise of online learning platforms offers great potential, not only for engineers looking to stay ahead of the big data curve, but for any professional interested in pursuing new skills mid-career, without sacrificing their job and going back to university full time. </p>

<p>With the move, Microsoft joins retailers like <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/10/amazon-embraces-the-future-with-its-own-3d-printing-section/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/03/staples-sells-first-3d-printer-cube/">Staples</a>, which both recently announced their own plans to sell 3D printers.</p>
<p>All of this is especially big news for 3D printing giant Stratasys, which <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/19/3d-printing-giant-stratasys-acquires-makerbot/">announced its plans to acquire MakerBot last week</a>. As both MakerBot CEO Bre Pettis and Stratasys CEO David Reis hinted at the time, one of the most important components of the acquisition was that it will help decrease the time it takes for MakerBot to manufacture its printers. This, in turn, means that it can create more of them, giving companies like Amazon, and now Microsoft, more stock to work with.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s retail news comes on the same day it announcement that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/26/windows-8-1-3d-printing-support/">Windows 8.1 will feature native support for 3D printing</a>, which is meant to be just as easy as plain old 2D printing.</p>

<p>Rather than just being a direct competitor to Google, Microsoft’s Bing search engine is morphing into a much more interesting animal.</p>
<p>The company announced Bing for Developers at its Build conference in San Francisco today, which opens up Bing’s data as a set of APIs for developers to implement in their Windows apps.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>“I learned a lesson in the ’90s when I was a developer on Windows OS,” said Microsoft VP Gurdeep Singh Pall on stage at the conference. “That is, if we can do something with an API that is good, third parties can do something that is dynamite.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="bing-for-developers" class="size-full wp-image-770320 aligncenter" height="451" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/bing-for-developers.jpg?w=655&amp;h=451" width="655" /></p>
<p>As the slide above shows, Bing for Developers will include the engine’s web index and knowledge graph, but it will also focus on the Natural User Interface, or NUI.</p>
<p>To show off what’s possible with the new integration, Pall demoed a companion travel app, which sported voice controls, a voice guide, Expedia integration, and Bing images integration. The app looked slick, but it was clearly produced for this particular demo.</p>
<p>Pall also revealed that the Bing Maps application in Windows 8.1 will (finally) include support for 3D imagery. That’s something Google has had for years, and Apple featured prominently in its troubled map app.</p>
<p>Bing for Developers is yet another way Microsoft is trying to tempt devs away from other platforms, but it remains to be seen if anyone will actually find these features interesting. The Bing brand has been something of a joke in the search world, so it’s not exactly the sort of thing that will excite developers.</p>

<p>Microsoft revealed a new feature for DirectX 11.2 and Windows 8.1 today called “tiled resources” that enables a graphics card to display a huge amount of detail without overwhelming it with memory-intensive textures.</p>
<p>Tiled resources automatically swaps in the details whenever a gamer is looking closely at it. This should enable developers to pack in tons of lifelike textures. This functionality is only available on Windows 8.1 and next-gen consoles.</p>
<p>“The motivation for doing something like this is to enable you to make games with unprecedented amounts of detail,” Microsoft vice president of Windows Antoine Leblond said in a presentation at the company’s Build conference today in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Leblond demonstrated this technology using a map of Mars that was blurry whenever he zoomed into the landscape. He then turned on tiled resources, which made the minutiae of the surface of Mars pop with crispness.</p>
<p>In a different demo, Leblond zoomed in on a glider to show its rivets and dirt smudges.</p>
<p>This feature should improve visual performance on any PC running Windows 8.1, and it is something developers will have access to on Xbox One.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Android users should never download apps from a third-party app store, apparently. But you should also take Chicken Little reports with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>A staggering 267,259 mobile apps are triggering SMS trojans, exploiting security holes, stealing private data, and building botnets, according to a <a href="http://newsroom.juniper.net/press-releases/juniper-networks-finds-mobile-threats-continue-ram-nyse-jnpr-1029552" target="_blank">study</a> released today by network security firm Juniper. Ninety-two percent of them are Android-based, and most of those are due to over 500 Android app stores globally that are known to be hosting mobile malware.</p>
<p>“We anticipate that similar to the evolution of PC-based threats, mobile attacks will continue to increase and become more sophisticated in the coming years,” Juniper mobile threat center director Troy Vennon said in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/sad-android.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="sad-android" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-707555" height="242" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/sad-android.jpg?w=300&amp;h=242" width="300" /></a>Juniper’s Mobile Threats Report analyzed 1.85 million mobile apps, up a third from February 2012, to find malware and vulnerabilities. According to the report overall mobile malware is skyrocketing — up 614 percent in a single year across all platforms — but Juniper says that Android is where the real challenges lie.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Android is the target of choice of thousands of malware authors simply due to the hundreds of non-Google app stores that offer almost no oversight and therefore enable easy distribution, and due to the continuing fragmentation of the Android ecosystem, which leaves users of earlier, less-secure versions of Android vulnerable. A third contributing factor is the fact that more apps asking for more private data.</p>
<p>There are big dollars to be made in getting your shady app installed.</p>
<p>Juniper says that 73 percent of all known malware are FakeInstallers or SMS Trojans. These apps look like legitimate apps from known sources, but they’ve actually been cracked and infected. When installed, they’ll send text messages to premium-rate numbers, harvesting a nice $10 payday for their authors, on average.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest reason Android is being targeted is its sheer success.</p>
<p>Android accounts for about <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/01/28/android-captured-almost-70-global-smartphone-market-share-in-2012-apple-just-under-20/">70 percent of all smartphones marketshare</a>, and with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/15/900m-android-activations-to-date-google-says/">900 million activations to date</a>, there’s a massive pool of users to exploit. While Apple’s iOS platform is huge as well, with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/21/apples-media-empire-575m-users-spending-20byear-on-apps-music-video-books/">575 million active app-downloading users</a>, it’s not as big, and it’s much harder to access, since Apple maintains strict controls over what makes it onto the app store.</p>
<p>While Google Play is probably one of the safest places to get Android apps, other well-known and credible app stores such as Amazon’s would also be safe. The problem is the 500-plus unknown stores that are allowing malware to thrive.</p>
<p>Most of those, Juniper said, are based in either Russia or China.</p>
<p>It’s worth taking results like these with at least one grain of salt. Juniper sells mobile security solutions, so the company has an opportunity to benefit if the mobile security situation appears grim. That doesn’t mean the company could be falsifying data, just that it’s not always clear what the definitions of malware are in every study.</p>
<p>For instance, Juniper is including apps that a sketchy on privacy — such as tracking your location — that are not necessarily malware.</p>
<p>It’s not immediately clear how many of the 276,259 total malicious apps that Juniper found fall into this bucket.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
One of the most popular trading ideas among tech funds is to short BlackBerry — more than 30% of its stock was sold short recently. And another very popular idea has been going long Apple, of course. As we all know, those two trading strategies went tragically awry last winter, when Apple’s share price plummeted from $700 to $400 and BlackBerry’s stock spiked from $6 to $18. This helped demolish the performances of many of the best known tech funds on Wall Street in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter in 2013. But that’s not the interesting part. The interesting part is that the weird winter trends seemed to have reversed in the spring and many funds</div>

</div></div><p>Digital advertising startup <a href="http://www.inadco.com" target="_blank">Inadco</a> has raised $11 million in its second round of funding.</p>
<p>Inadco helps brands create more compelling, targeted advertising campaigns. The system identifies high-intent consumers and then uses machine learning technology to decide which ad is likely to be the most effective.</p>
<p>The goal is to capture demand, rather than generate demand. Inadco’s “intention-driven Form Ads” are intended to provide a better experience for consumers that doesn’t involve “clunky URLs and an endless sea of splash pages.” It integrates native ads into the content of a site or app so the consumer doesn’t have to leave the page. Inadco also opens up a two-way communication so marketers can engage directly with consumers.</p>
<p>U.S. Venture Partners led this second round of funding, with participation from existing investor Redpoint Ventures, which led Inadco’s $5 million Series A. With this financing, the company will hire more engineers and continue to build out its technology platform. The startup is based in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.jonkri.com/updated-yabasta-protocol/">Jon Kristensen: Updated Yabasta Protocol</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The end-to-end secure <a href="https://github.com/jonkri/yabasta-protocol/">Yabasta protocol</a> has received a significant update.</p>
<p>The protocol now supports a higher degree of anonymity. The public key is no longer automatically transferred in the authenticated key exchange (as is the case with <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">the Off-the-Record protocol</a>). Instead, the key exchange only exposes a signature. Users can then perform various identity verification actions (such as “challenges”) to increase their trust in the remote peer before they reveal their public key. This is done so that clients can choose to consider their public keys a secret credential, and not automatically reveal their public keys to an active man-in-the-middle attacker.</p>
<p>The protocol has also been made more flexible. Clients can now configure things like what prime numbers to use for the Diffie-Hellman calculations, as well as what cryptographic and signing algorithms to use.</p>
<p>Other updates include a separation between the abstract method and the actual protocol implementation, various clean-ups, and additional explanations to make the document easier to understand.</p>
<p>These new features will be used in the upcoming prototype release of <a href="https://yabasta.com/">Yabasta</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p></div>

</div></div><p>Major brands are increasingly looking for ways to appear innovative, form partnerships with entrepreneurs, and connect with other key people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.britishairways.com" target="_blank">British Airways</a> recently showed other brands how it’s done with its “<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/14/brainstorming-at-30k-feet-reflections-from-the-hackathon-in-the-sky/">hackathon in the sky</a>,” a partnership-driven effort to steal Virgin’s crown as the hip upstart airline.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="http://www.sponsorfied.com/" target="_blank">Sponsorfied</a> launched last year to foster relationships between companies, artists, and entrepreneurs. Today, the team announced that it’s rebranding itself as “<a href="http://partnered.co" target="_blank">Partnered</a>,” and is undergoing a shift in direction to partnerships, not just sponsorship opportunities.</p>
<p>The team say the pivot is a result of experiences working with hundreds of brands, and lessons learned from the first product.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/21/sponsorfied-says-well-do-for-sponsorship-what-google-did-for-targeted-ads/">company launched</a> last year with the bold promise that ”it would do for sponsorships what Google did for targeted ads.” But the team realized that the term “sponsorship” implies financial backing for an organization or individual, who don’t necessarily offer anything in return.</p>
<p>“These relationships are all about deeper collaborations and mutually beneficial agreements,” CEO Baldwin Cunningham told me. “We feel the definition of sponsorships is changing so broadening of our name was needed.”</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company is also releasing new products for brands and agencies, known as “Direct” and “Manage.”</p>
<p>Direct is a curation service for brands to discover cool sponsorship or partnership opportunities; Cunningham describes it as “flash sales for brand sponsorship.” The Manage product is a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for marketing and events management folk, and is designed replace tiresome Excel spreadsheets and PDFs.</p>
<p>In the past, Sponsorfied has worked with brands like Samsung, who agreed to pay for prolific Instagrammer <a href="http://instagram.com/ikedeani" target="_blank">Ike Edeani</a> (who boasts over 350,000 followers) to make a trip to the SXSW Interactive conference in Austin.</p>
<p>The Sponsorfied site will remain live for now, but will gradually be phased out as the company transitions to the new system.</p>
<p>Partnered is not the only startup in this space, but is one of the trendiest in the lot, and works with hot brands like Warby Parker and Pop Water. The new company competes with legacy players like Conxeo and Versaic.</p>
<p>The company has disclosed that it’s raised $170,000 on graduation from elite accelerator Y Combinator, and a further $100,000 from Funders Club. Investors include social media brand consultant Gary Vaynerchuk, angel investor, Mike Rothenberg, and Menlo Ventures’ Shervin Pishevar.</p>

</div></div><p>Facebook has finally announced a native app for Windows 8 –nine months after the operating system’s release.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/26/microsoft-build-2013-day-1-live-blog/">Microsoft’s CEO Steve Ballmer announced the app on stage</a> at Microsoft’s Build conference today in San Francisco alongside native versions of Flipboard and NFL Fantasy Football.</p>
<p>The move, of course, is a big deal for Windows 8, which is slowly but surely building its app catalog. The more high-quality apps Microsoft can claim on the platform, the more legitimate Windows 8 looks in the eyes of both consumers and developers.</p>
<p>But Facebook’s journey to Windows 8 has hardly been an easy one. When we asked Facebook last October whether it was developing a Windows 8 app, the company <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/30/facebook-says-it-isnt-building-a-windows-8-app-directs-us-to-microsoft/">directed us to Microsoft and dodged the question</a>.</p>
<p>“We only build the iOS and Android FB apps. You should check in with Microsoft on anything related to Windows 8,” the company said at the time.</p>
<p>Clearly, Facebook is changing its tune now, which we’re sure Microsoft is glad to hear.</p>

</div></div><p><a href="http://www.datatorrent.com" target="_blank">DataTorrent</a> has raised $8 million to bring data analytics up to warp speed.</p>
<p>The startup claims to take data processing from real time into “now time.” Enterprises that generate continuous streams of large unstructured data can use DataTorrent to process, monitor, analyze, and act on it. Founder Phu Hoang said the system executes at tens of million of data items per second.</p>
<p>“Data has proliferated and velocity has continued to increase, with the onslaught driven by the growth in the number of mobile phones, financial transactions, advertising, social gaming, online payments, online sensors, and industrial sensors,” said Hoang. “This means there is massive data coming in that needs to be processed. With this comes the fact that businesses more and more need to make sense and act on their data in real time.”</p>
<p>DataTorrent also has an open-sourced library of 250 operators to facilitate quick application development and foster community. The platform is built on to of Hadoop 2.0, which Hoang said provides “unprecedented” scale, load elasticity, and no data-loss. Hadoop is a popular open source computing framework that makes it easier for large corporations to manage large volumes of data that can’t be stored in a traditional database.</p>
<p>Hoang previously worked as the executive vice president of engineering at Yahoo, and cofounder Amol Kekre built the Yahoo quotes streaming service and was a leader in the Hadoop efforts at there. The founders observed a “tectonic shift” happening surrounding “big data” — there are over nine billion devices connected to the Internet, and data generation is also projected to grow to 35 zettabytes in 2020, according to IDC. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/04/here-comes-the-zettabyte-age/" target="_blank">In the words of my editor, Dylan Tweney</a>, this is a “crapload,” and organizations need increasingly more sophisticated technology to make use of it.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Hadoop startups are attracting millions from investors.<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/06/cloudera-fundraise/"> Cloudera closed $65 million in December</a>, MapR raised $30 million, and Accel Partners formed a $100 million fund dedicated to big data startups. August Capital led this round, with participation from Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures, Morado Ventures, and Farzad Nazem who invested in the seed round.</p>
<p>The company is based in Santa Clara and has 12 employees.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Verizon seems to have heard enough about studies showing that AT&amp;T’s LTE network is the fastest in the United States. Bloomberg reports that Verizon “is planning a sweeping upgrade of its network this year after surging congestion and deteriorating speed allowed AT&amp;T to close the gap on service quality.” The report notes that Verizon is in some ways a victim of its own success since the carrier’s biggest problem is the congestion that has come from being the most popular wireless carrier in the U.S. To that end, the company is looking to aggressively expand capacity on its network by using the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum that it acquired from several cable companies last year to effectively double the speeds of</div>

<h4><a href="http://isode.com/company/wordpress/r16-m-link-console-changes/">Isode: R16 M-Link Console changes</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<img alt="" height="50" src="http://isode.com/company/wordpress//wp-content/uploads/2011/11/news1.png" title="News" width="24" /><br /><p>We’ve made some small alterations to the <a href="http://www.isode.com/Documentation/XMPPEVAL.pdf">XMPP Evaluation Guide</a> today to reflect changes to M-Link Console (MLC), the  management GUI for our M-Link XMPP server, made in R16.0.</p>
<p>The  main difference between the old and new evaluation guides is the  merging of the node and service views in MLC to make control over node  and service level functionality easier; however, this isn’t the only  change we’ve made to MLC to improve management capabilities from R16.0  onwards:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to <strong>manage TLS configuration remotely</strong>, which makes it possible to configure TLS across multiple cluster nodes from a single instance of M-Link Console.</li>
<li><strong>Headless server setup</strong>.  Full client/server management will enable M-Link Console support for  setting up M-Link on a headless server. M-Link Console will provide  information on command line startup which can be used to initiate a  server with appropriate local configuration.</li>
<li>We’ve introduced Strong Authentication support as an option for <strong>M-Link Console authentication</strong> to M-Link.</li>
<li>Provide <strong>Smart Card support</strong> for M-Link Console authentication to M-Link. This is currently Windows  only, and is a precursor to smart card support in other parts of the  Isode product set.</li>
<li>We’ve introduced an<strong> Integrated Statistics view</strong> and other general UI improvements including  a <strong>Security Check List tab</strong> and a <strong>System Diagnostics view</strong> to make checks on local machine to validate configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll  be editing the product web pages shortly to show screenshots of some of  this new functionality and we’ll let you know when that’s done. In the  meantime we’d encourage customers and evaluators to download R16 today  and explore the new features themselves. <a href="http://www.isode.com/support/docs.html#admin">Administration Guides</a> for R16.0  are now available from the website.</p></div>
